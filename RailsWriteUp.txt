1)Create a new Rails API:
    rails new <appname> --api
cd into the app created
go to the gemfile to add the rack cors:
    this might just need to be uncommented.
then need to install the rack cors gem:
    bundle install
Need to go to config > initializers and uncoimment the cors section:
    set origins to "*" 
        this would allow anyone to access it
    or
    origins "http://localhost:3001" 
        this is for the react frontend
        inf production this would be the actual URL
Start building out the backend
    rails g scaffold <dbname> name:type name:type
    rails destroy <dbname> if made a mistake before migrate command
Then migrate the DB so that it is actually fully built
    db migrate
Config the routes to the db
    go to config => routes and add namespaces as such
        namespace :<name> do 
            namespace : <name> do
                resource: <name>    name here is the db to be accessed
            end
        end
Go into the app > controllers folder 
Add in nested folders that match the path of the namespace
    app
        controllers
            <first namespace name>
                <second namespace name>
                    resource controller here
In the resource controller then adjust the path to match the folders
    class <first namespace name>::<second namespace name>::<name>Controller < ApplicationController
        ex. class Api::V1::UsersController < ApplicationController
Testing api check the following path
    localhost:3000
    loclahost:3000/api/v1/{route name}
Can add data to the DB with the rails console
    rails c
    Can view the DB to see what data is in it by
        {Dbname}
    Can add data into the db by the following
        {Dbname}.create!("firstdbcolumnname":{data}, "secondDBcolumnname":{data})
    Can view by starting the server and going to the above URL
Within the rails API folder create the react app
    npx create-react-app <app name>
