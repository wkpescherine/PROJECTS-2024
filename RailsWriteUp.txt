1)Create a new Rails API:
    rails new <appname> --api
cd into the app created
go to the gemfile to add the rack cors:
    this might just need to be uncommented.
then need to install the rack cors gem:
    bundle install
Need to go to config > initializers and uncoimment the cors section:
    set origins to "*" 
        this would allow anyone to access it
    or
    origins "http://localhost:3001" 
        this is for the react frontend
        inf production this would be the actual URL
Start building out the backend
    rails g scaffold <dbname> name:type name:type
    rails destroy <dbname> if made a mistake before migrate command
Then migrate the DB so that it is actually fully built
